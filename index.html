                   I love collecting clothes and sneakers, buying and selling them too. I also practice Football when I can. I'm a student at Léonard de Vinci's management school since september. And with LE WAGON, I really learned how to code and I appreciate it  !

                              When I'm free, I love making beats, lyrics for my friends or I rap sometimes. I also play videogames since I was young. We can say, that these are my two favorite activities !

                              I've been playing at the Versailles Footbal club when I was teenager, that means I have a good level in this sport. And now, I'm working as a referee in a Urbansoccer center after school.
